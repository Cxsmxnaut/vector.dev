/**
 * Which Home issued an invitation link.
 *
 * Child 05 §8 is explicit about this: the Homes producer owns the explicit-target
 * carrier encoding, its link parser, identity validation and target resolution,
 * and the join controller consumes that one resolver. When the Home cannot be
 * resolved the contract names the existing explicit-target discovery flow — and
 * names what must *not* happen: "not the chooser, focused Home, `location.origin`,
 * or an arbitrary sign-in service".
 *
 * That prohibition is a disclosure rule, not a preference. The path segment of a
 * join link is a live bearer. Asking a Home to preview it tells that Home the
 * secret, so a Home may only be asked once the link itself has named it. A single
 * saved Home is not evidence that it minted the invitation, and neither is the
 * focused one.
 *
 * The carrier is the Home's **portable** identity — the same
 * `homeServerIdentityId` the Home publishes in its connection descriptor — not a
 * device-local `ServerProfile.id`. Those two are different namespaces: a profile
 * id is local routing storage that differs per device, so comparing the carrier
 * to it would fail on every device except the one that happened to mint a
 * matching id, and could in principle match an unrelated Home. The identity-aware
 * profile resolver is the canonical owner of that lookup, including the legacy
 * identifiers a Home has been known by, and this module consumes it rather than
 * re-deriving the rule.
