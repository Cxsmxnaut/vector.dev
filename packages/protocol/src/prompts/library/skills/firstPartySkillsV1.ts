authenticated to the intended Happier Home. Read \`happier --help\`, then
\`happier skills --help\`, \`happier mcp --help\`, or \`happier session --help\` as needed.
The CLI uses its own authenticated identity; it does not inherit this turn's
requester. Do not switch channels to bypass a refusal or approval requirement.
If a requester cannot be identified, ask the person to send a fresh request from
their signed-in Happier app. If no usable channel is available, say so.
